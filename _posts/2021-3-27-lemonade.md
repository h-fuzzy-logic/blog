<h1 class="h4">Introduction</h1>
If you find yourself in a less-than-perfect job and have too many grown-up responsibilities to simply quit, read on for some strategies to use your current situation to help you land your next gig.  I recently [switched from software engineering to data engineering]({% post_url 2021-3-27-career-transition %}) and these strategies helped me be successful.   

<h1 class="h4">Finding the upside</h1>
Take advantage of every opportunity in your current role.  These are some possibilities that might not be obvious when you feel stuck.   Can you:
* Practice being an everyday leader?
* Expand your LinkedIn network by connecting with co-workers?
* Create time for professional development by using your paid leave (PTO or holiday)?
* Use company-paid training time to learn a new skill? 
* Use your lunch break or paid breaks to learn a new skill? 
* Pair up with a co-worker to work on a side project? 
* Run for office in an employee club? 
* Offer to help your manager accomplish his/her goals? 
* Review and record your experiences, in preparation for behavioral interview questions?
* Present a ‘lunch and learn’ session to hone your presentation skills? 

<h1 class="h4">Conclusion</h1>
From my experience, feeling stuck in a job is a good way to practice recognizing the good in every situation and letting constraints fuel creativity.   Focusing on the opportunities instead of the blockers of my not-quite-right role helped me land a new job.  And it gave me some great answers to behavioral interview questions like “Tell me about a time when you removed bureaucracy” and  “Tell me about a time you received negative feedback” and “Tell me about a time you learned a new skill.”
