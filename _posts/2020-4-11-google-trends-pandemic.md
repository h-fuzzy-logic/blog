<h1 class="h4">Introduction</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US" target="_blank">Google Trends</a> shows interest over time in various Google searches: web, image, news, Google Shopping, and YouTube, in different regions of the world.  To get started, usually some brainstorming is needed to create an initial list of search terms for comparison.  After comparing the initial list, Google Trends provides suggestions which can be added to the comparison list or may spawn new ideas.
</p>

<h1 class="h4">How the trend data is presented</h1>
<p>
Google Trends provides a visual view and also allows downloading a CSV of the raw data, which can be used in other applications.  Since the visuals do not allow customization, it is handy to work with the CSV in a visualization tool (such as Tableau Public) to make customizations.   
</p>

<h1 class="h4">Explanation of how to interpret the data, verbatim from Google </h1>
<p>
“Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.”
</p>

<h1 class="h4">Uses of Google Trends data</h1>
<p>
One use is to see over time the most popular ways to search for a topic.  Another usage is to compare different search terms to see which have been used the most.  Having this knowledge can be especially helpful to those publishing information about the pandemic.  For example, if the CDC has mostly been using the term coronavirus, perhaps the organization can claim that its campaigns are working.  On the other hand, if the CDC has not been using the term coronavirus, perhaps it should start. 
</p>

<h1 class="h4">Google Trends for the terms coronavirus, covid, covid19, covid-19, pandemic</h1>  
<p>
The viz at the top shows the level of interest for those five terms in the US from 1/1/2020 to 4/8/2020.  The term coronavirus had its highest level of interest on 3/15/2020, and it was about 10x more popular that day than the term covid.

<h1 class="h4">Further areas of exploration</h1> 
1. Are there any regions (states or metro areas) that don’t follow the trends?   If so, what can be learned from those outliers?
1. By zooming in on a single state, is there anything interesting? 
1. By expanding out to the world level, what does the data look like? 
1. Can public health campaigns explain the levels of interest?  Has the CDC been using the term coronavirus more?  
1. Do public health campaigns need to start using the term coronavirus more? 

<h1 class="h4">Summary</h1>  
<p>
  Google Trends data can be used as a tool to understand how users are thinking about a topic and when they are interested in it.  The trends can drive decisions such as what words to use and when to post content.
