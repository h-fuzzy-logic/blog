<h1 class="h4">Introduction</h1>
Many times during 2020 I thought of a quote from one of my favorite books _Their Eyes Were Watching God_ by Zora Neale Hurston: “There are years that ask questions and years that answer.”  
  
<h1 class="h4">All of those day-to-day questions about logistics: </h1>
* Can you hear me? 
* Is it safe to go? 
* Will I have a job next month?
* Are we taking vacation this year?
* Has our order shipped? 
* Where is my mask? 
* Where is your mask? 
* Have you heard the medical helicopter fly over today?
* Mom, when will the sickness be over?
* Mom, when is preschool going to start?

<h1 class="h4">The questions got harder as the year progressed: </h1>
* But how are you, **really**? 
* Why are people pretending that everything is normal?
* How could the popular vote be so close?
* What do I want to be when I grow up?
* What truly makes me happy? 
* How can I learn all of this?
* Who can help me? 

<h1 class="h4">Conclusion </h1>
And 2020 started to answer, reminding me there are still kind, selfless people in the world who want to connect and help.  I just needed to look a little harder, in my contacts, on LinkedIn, on Twitter and actually ask for help with the things I want to learn and understand.  Even with a pandemic, wildfires, an earthquake, and demands for social justice, 2020 reminded me that technology can connect me with people who will help me make sense of the world.  I’m looking for many more answers in 2021.
