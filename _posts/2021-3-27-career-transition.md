<h1 class="h4">Introduction</h1>
After a two year journey to learn more about data science, big data, and cloud, I have accepted a new job as a data engineer.  I am excited to try something new, to use my software engineering skills in a different way.  My journey started with me thinking that I’d be on my own to skill-up, that I needed to dig-in, focus, and work hard, but I eventually realized that I would not be successful alone.  I am so thankful for the people (many being total strangers) who have helped me along the way.  Several people have asked me how I accomplished my goal and this is my attempt to document what I did.  Although I work in a technical field, I think these ideas would work with other fields too.    

  
<h1 class="h4">Figure out what you need to learn</h1>
Regularly review job postings for the kind of role you seek.  My go-to was an <a href="https://www.indeed.com" target="_blank">Indeed</a> scheduled email alert.  Once you learn the technical and soft skills employers want, create your custom **learning plan** and **networking plan** to address your deficiencies.    

<h1 class="h4">Learning can be free</h1>
Take advantage of free resources when possible.  Many vendors such as Microsoft, Snowflake, and Databricks offer free hour-long and half-day workshops that give you hands on practice with the newest tools.  All three cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP) offer free trials with credits to get you started.  Popular enterprise grade software often has a free version that will allow you to learn.  For example, Tableau Public is completely free and will allow you to publish your work so that you can feature it on your resume or LinkedIn profile.  Keep an eye out for free (virtual) conferences from software vendors and professional organizations.  My hometown public library even had some technical ebooks, audiobooks, and physical books that helped.  In addition to technical skills, brush up on your networking and job searching skills.  Springboard published some wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8BDl8g8xLM" target="_blank">"Weekly Career Coach" videos</a> on YouTube.  

<h1 class="h4">Get connected with like minded people</h1>
Maximize your LinkedIn connections and consider connecting with people you have never met in person.  While it may seem uncomfortable to send an invitation to someone you’ve never met, the year 2020 made it much more acceptable since in-person networking stopped.  After trying it a few times, I found it to be not so awkward.  Be sure to write a custom message with each connection request.  (A quick internet search can give you some good starting points.)  These are some ideas for connections:  
* Current and previous co-workers
* Authors of blog posts that are helpful
* Instructors of completed LinkedIn courses
* Presenters and attendees of attended webinars 
* People who have the kind of job you seek
* People who work at companies you like
* Career coaches
* Members of LinkedIn Groups to which you belong

On Twitter, follow people who have the type of job you want as well as experts in the field. Really listen and read the content they post.  Consider joining specialized communities such as <a href="https://powertofly.com" target="_blank">PowerToFly</a>, <a href="http://www.storytellingwithdata.com" target="_blank">Storytelling With Data</a>, or <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/networks" target="_blank">Women Who Code</a>.  Virtual book clubs and other specialized groups can offer opportunities to connect as well.  Through the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-big-data/" target="_blank">Women In Big Data Group on LinkedIn</a>, I found a team to join to participate in a data science competition and learned so much.

Work to find people who will spend one-on-one time with you.  Tell your trusted connections that you are considering a career transition and ask if they know anyone who can help you.  When I told a former manager about wanting to learn more about data, she immediately connected me with someone in her network who offered to informally mentor me and give me feedback about my side projects.  After completing an excellent LinkedIn Learning course, I searched the internet for the instructor and found that she offered a virtual apprenticeship program.  I followed the instructions for "applying" and was accepted.  

<h1 class="h4">Resume refresh</h1>
If hiring a career coach or professional resume writer seems out of reach, explore free options.  My alma mater’s Career Services office provided resume reviews (regardless of graduation date).  Some recruiting offices offer free resume reviews.  And so does [PowerToFly](https://powertofly.com).  Consider adding a section to your resume to highlight your learning and side projects.  A section called “Professional Development” can hold subcategories like "Personal Blog," "Courses," and "Project-Based Learning" and shows that you are a lifelong learner who has experience even if your employment history does not match your desired role.  

<h1 class="h4">Published works</h1>
If you enjoy writing, start a blog to detail your progress along the way.  Your posts can help you solidify your understanding and also demonstrate your progress to potential employers.  GitHub Gists and public repositories can also showcase your new skills.  Projects do not have to be 100% complete or perfect - be sure to identify next steps and areas for improvement and be prepared to explain your thought process and approach to overcome obstacles.   

<h1 class="h4">Conclusion</h1>
My advice to job seekers is to balance time spent on individual learning with time spent connecting and learning from others.  Even though I did not have work experience as a data engineer, during interviews I was able to talk about relevant side projects and connections with others to demonstrate technical skills and soft skills.
